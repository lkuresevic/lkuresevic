# About Me
I'm a Computer Science student pursuing a BSc at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad. My domains of interest revolve around addressing challenges posed by an era of computing post-Moore's law (primarily through **electronic design automation** and **domain specific compilers**).

# Check out my projects:

* **Detecting anomalies** on attributed networks: [repo](https://github.com/lkuresevic/anomaly-detection)
* Comparing neural network architectures for **environmental sound classification**: [repo](https://github.com/lkuresevic/urban_sound_classifier)
* **Predicting citations** (*links*) between scientific publications: [repo](https://github.com/lkuresevic/sci-pub-link-prediction)

## 💻 Electronic Design Automation
* Evaluating the effect of different netlist orders on performance of **VPR**'s implementation of **PathFinder**: [repo](https://github.com/lkuresevic/orderfinder-for-pathfinder/tree/main)

## 🎲 Probability Theory
