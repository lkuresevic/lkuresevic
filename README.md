# About Me
I'm a Computer Science student pursuing a BSc at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad. My domains of interest revolve around **machine learning** and **electronic design automation**. Currently, I am exploring [reinforcement learning in logic synthesis](https://github.com/lkuresevic/reinforcement_learning_in_logic_synthesis).
